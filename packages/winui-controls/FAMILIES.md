# Control families and application services

These public models and injectable renderer contributions are imported through `@sharpforge/winui-controls`. Managed host integration is supplied by later declared predecessors and never inferred from a pure model test.

## Family registration policy

`defaultControlTemplates`, `defaultControlTemplate`, `materializeDefaultControlStyle` and `controlVisualStates` describe actual named visuals, template bindings and per-instance states. Button style padding is applied once by managed layout. Unknown controls receive no fabricated template. Renderer registration preserves caller ownership and explicit override policy; capability requests remain host-owned.

## Application and window lifetime

`ApplicationSession`, `WindowSession`, `VisibilityLifecycle` and `ActivationService` own independent app/window state and events. Closing waits for cancellation and deferral decisions before finalization. Snapshot restoration does not replay external activation or device effects. Deadline clocks and platform services are injected.

## Localization and data transfer

`ResourceLoader`, `ResourceManager`, `ResourceMap`, `ResourceContext`, `importResw` and `languageFallbacks` own language refresh and resource lookup. `DataPackage`, `ClipboardService` and `LauncherService` retain explicit caller-supplied backends and origin/grant policy. Denied clipboard operations return a reason and denied launches return false; no global fallback clipboard is fabricated.

## Managed application adapters

`managedDataPackage` and `createDataPackageView` expose the same authoritative data-transfer state used by drag/drop and clipboard operations. Application/window and resource adapters register through the caller-owned UI extension registry. Windows finalize only after their managed Closed decision commits; the host supplies windowClosed/applicationExited and task/permission services.

## Qualification

The complete A16 scope gate ran at d91e0817: 373 tests, 339 passed and 34 failed. Each publication manifest identifies its recorded cases and subsequent repairs; failures remain visible. Required core is pending on each exact publication tree. Native WinUI oracle, browser IME, codec, OS permission and performance evidence are separate qualifications. No speedup or native parity is claimed without a recorded measurement.
