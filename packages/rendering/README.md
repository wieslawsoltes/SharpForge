# @sharpforge/rendering

Application-owned retained drawing services for SharpForge. The package registers no global mutable state and accepts platform resources through explicit owners.

## Resource ownership

`ResourceTable` rejects stale, foreign and mistyped handles, retains mutable resource versions and delays disposal until the final GPU submission completes. `DeltaUpload` keeps bounded typed storage and uploads only changed aligned ranges.

## Drawing lists

`DrawingContext` records shape, image, text and layer commands in DIP coordinates. `DisplayList` seals immutable snapshots, validates its versioned wire envelope, replays through an injected adapter and diffs retained element versions. Opaque platform objects require resource handles before serialization.

## Retained delegates and transforms

`RenderDelegateRegistry` resolves contributions through declared base types. `DisplayListTreeBuilder` preserves content through placement changes and reports unsupported visuals. Released rectangles, elliptical radii, stroke-only shapes and line commands lower into the same drawing list. Affine helpers define composition order and singular-inverse handling.

## Brushes and images

Solid, linear and radial brushes share explicit color, opacity, transform, interpolation and spread rules. `ImageCache` owns decoded images through cancellation and eviction. `WriteableBitmap` snapshots its exact pixel storage and publishes invalidation. Image fitting and nine-grid placement preserve the requested source rectangle and alignment.

## Device lifetime

`GpuDevice` coalesces acquisition for surfaces owned by one app, publishes loss/recovery epochs and owns per-epoch pipeline caches. Buffer and texture pools publish reusable leases only after submission retirement has cleared. Borrowing surfaces do not dispose the shared device.

## Glyph and texture residency

`GlyphAtlas` bounds live glyph metadata and raster pages, preserves pages pinned by retained plans, and distinguishes font version, size, density and subpixel phase. Dirty shelves upload incrementally; first residency and recovery upload the full texture. Empty glyphs preserve advances and pending decodes are retried.

## Validation

Focused cases were authored and included in the completed A17 scope gate. The publication manifest records its exact prior evidence and any subsequent repair. Required core is pending on this exact branch tree. Browser pixels, native WinUI comparisons and physical GPU qualification are separate gates.
