# @sharpforge/rendering

Application-owned retained drawing services for SharpForge. The package registers no global mutable state and accepts platform resources through explicit owners.

## Resource ownership

`ResourceTable` rejects stale, foreign and mistyped handles, retains mutable resource versions and delays disposal until the final GPU submission completes. `DeltaUpload` keeps bounded typed storage and uploads only changed aligned ranges.

## Drawing lists

`DrawingContext` records shape, image, text and layer commands in DIP coordinates. `DisplayList` seals immutable snapshots, validates its versioned wire envelope, replays through an injected adapter and diffs retained element versions. Opaque platform objects require resource handles before serialization.

## Retained delegates and transforms

`RenderDelegateRegistry` resolves contributions through declared base types. `DisplayListTreeBuilder` preserves content through placement changes and reports unsupported visuals. Released rectangles, elliptical radii, stroke-only shapes and line commands lower into the same drawing list. Affine helpers define composition order and singular-inverse handling.

## Path geometry

`parsePath` normalizes relative and absolute SVG-style commands, arcs and smooth controls into immutable geometry. Geometry bounds include transformed curve extrema. Flattening uses target-space error tolerance; fill hit testing preserves winding rules and rejects malformed or cyclic descriptors.

## Fills, strokes and painted bounds

Scanbeam tessellation preserves holes and self-intersections. Strokes preserve dash seams, cap dots, joins and explicit work/vertex budgets. Painted bounds include transforms, stroke extent, glyph overhang and conservative shadow/effect expansion.

## Independent path fixtures

The path corpus includes100 distinct valid cases, malformed syntax boundaries and pinned licensed Fluent assets. Independent SVG/Path2D capture helpers provide browser references without calling the renderer tessellator. Their presence is not recorded as executed browser pixel qualification.

## Validation

Focused cases were authored and included in the completed A17 scope gate. The publication manifest records its exact prior evidence and any subsequent repair. Required core is pending on this exact branch tree. Browser pixels, native WinUI comparisons and physical GPU qualification are separate gates.
