# BCL core

This package owns BCL family contracts and managed implementations. It has no
runtime or framework dependency. Hosts supply `bclHost.fault(type, message)`,
`bclHost.isReference(value)` and `bclHost.frameworkType(name)` on each platform.
The fault service must throw the host's managed exception.

Each family module has `name`, `families`, `contracts(registry)` and
`invoke(platform, descriptor, arguments)` members. Invocation returns
`{handled: true, value}` or `{handled: false}` synchronously. Module registration
is validated before publication, with a constant-time family lookup per call.
Registries are independent and immutable; managed state stays in the host heap.
`registry.invoke` and `invokeBclModules` accept an optional fourth argument with
the already resolved owner type. The registry passes it to the module's `invoke`
method; omitting it retains the host lookup, and `null` means an unknown type.

Add a module to `src/modules.js` to make it available to framework registration,
runtime dispatch and the generated inventory. The extracted release 13 and 14
modules use explicit registration groups to preserve every existing contract ID.
New modules use the `extensions` group in the reserved A07 range. Registering a
module through the framework remains transactional.
An existing module may provide `extensionContracts(registry)` for additional
members in that reserved range. The `extensions` registration group invokes
this hook separately from the module's released `contracts` hook; both hooks
must be synchronous. Registration without a group, including selection by
module name, invokes both hooks in order. The caller supplies the ID reservation;
framework composition uses the separate groups to preserve released IDs.

Run `node packages/bcl-core/scripts/inventory.js` to regenerate the documented
surface; `--check` compares the checked-in output. Public String, StringBuilder,
Array and Random metadata is pinned to .NET 10.0.5 and SDK 10.0.201, with native
extractor and source hashes. Exact signature presence is reported separately
from behavioral qualification; this extraction does not claim complete BCL parity.

`formatDoubleDefault(value)` formats a JavaScript binary64 number as invariant
.NET default text, including signed zero, shortest round-trip digits, uppercase
exponents padded to two digits, and the `NaN`/`Infinity` spellings. It is pure and
does not allocate managed memory. The shared numeric formatter also supports
`G`/`g` with the existing 0..99 precision limit and `R`/`r` for floating-point
values. The fifty-value .NET 10.0.5 fixture in `reference/double-format-net10.json`
qualifies binary64 default, general and round-trip output; it does not qualify
Single or Decimal formatting. Runtime display adapters reuse this helper while
retaining their engine-specific object, enum and typed integer handling.

StringBuilder reports the .NET default `MaxCapacity` of `Int32.MaxValue`
(`2147483647`) in both metadata and execution. The host separately limits text
and requested capacity to 1,000,000 UTF-16 code units. Exceeding that allocation
budget raises `OutOfMemoryException`; negative capacities and capacities below
the current length raise `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`. The host budget is not
a claim that allocations up to .NET's maximum can be satisfied. Constructor
defaults are captured in `reference/builder-format/oracle.json` against the
pinned .NET toolchain, and source/direct CIL regression tests consume the capture.

Composite formatting follows the pinned .NET brace and ASCII-space grammar:
`{0 ,5}` is valid, `{ 0}` is invalid, and escaped closing braces after a format
item are processed as literal text. StringBuilder retains text written before
a later malformed item raises `FormatException`. Its `AppendFormat(string,
params object[])` overload supports expanded arguments, an explicit array and
zero arguments through the compiler's existing params lowering. The new
overload occupies reserved A07 ID `524288`; released IDs remain unchanged.
Formatting still uses the supported invariant numeric formats and the host's
1,000,000-unit output budget, rather than claiming the full .NET formatting API.
